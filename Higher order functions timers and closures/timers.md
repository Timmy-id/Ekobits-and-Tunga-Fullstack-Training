## Timers

1. setInterval allows for a function to be run once, after a set interval of time
    setTimeout allows a function to be run repeatedly beginning after a set interval of time and then repeating continuosly at that interval.
    
2. The difference between `setInterval` and `loop` is that `setInterval` is timed and `loop` is not timed. You might want to use one over the other when the condition to be met 
    is timely .
3. The first parameter that `setInterval` and `setTimeout` accept is a callback function.
4. It is important to store the result of `setInterval` and `setTimeout` in a variable so as to be able to stop the timer.
5. `Asynchronous` in the context of `setInterval` and `setTimeout` means that a function wil be executed after a set interval of time.
